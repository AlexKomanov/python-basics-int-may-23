# Python - Ex - Modules

Write a module named `add_mod.py` defines an `add()` function which receives two numbers and **returns their sum**.

Write a module named `mul_mod.py` defines a `mul()` function which receives two
numbers and returns its multiplication **WITHOUT** implicit multiplication but only by using the `add()` function from the `add_mod.py` module.

Write a main module named `main.py` that calls and uses the `mul()` function and validate its correct behavior.
